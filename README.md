# Wordle-Low-Budget

## Overview

The project is carried out within the Computer Systems Architecture course and is based on Claude Shannon's Information Theory. We recreated the famous Wordle game that became popular in 2021. What is special about our project is that by combining the 2 ideas, we recreated a Wordle that plays itself making the best word choices.

## About GUI

The graphic interface was made with the help of [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

## The non-automated version

This project also contains the non-automated version. All you have to do to be able to play is to enter the "Versiunea Neautomatizata" directory, download the code and run it in any IDE.

## Must know:

- Each word attempt has a 5 second delay to ensure that the function that calculates the next word has time to calculate it
- The words are in Romanian and were automatically scanned from several dictionaries, for this reason there are still some words that do not necessarily make sense.
- The average word finding is about 4
